SCENARIO 1: E-commerce Sales Data
Analyze a sample e-commerce dataset to understand product categories, sales trends, and missing information.
Dataset- (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data
Discription of the code:
           This Python program analyzes and visualizes sales data using the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries. The dataset is loaded and inspected to understand its structure and missing values. Invalid records with zero or negative quantity and unit price are removed. A new column, TotalSales, is created to calculate the total value of each transaction. The data is grouped by product description to identify and visualize the top ten products based on total sales using a bar chart. The invoice date is converted into datetime format, and daily total sales are plotted using a line graph to study sales trends over time. Overall, the program helps analyze product performance and sales patterns effectively.

SCENARIO 2: Hospital Patient Records
Examine a patient dataset to identify missing health metrics and visualize distributions.
Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database
Discription of the code:
           This Python program analyzes a diabetes dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib. The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and missing values. Medically invalid zero values are replaced with missing values to improve data quality. A histogram is used to visualize the distribution of glucose levels, while a box plot shows the age distribution and potential outliers. Overall, the program helps in cleaning and understanding the dataset effectively.

SCENARIO 3: Housing Dataset
Investigate a housing dataset for missing features and relationships between house attributes.
Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction
Discription of the code:  
            This Python program analyzes a housing dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset is loaded and checked for missing values to understand data quality. A scatter plot is used to visualize the relationship between house area and price. A heatmap is then created to show the correlation between numerical features in the dataset. Overall, the program helps identify relationships and patterns in housing data through visualization.

SCENARIO 4: Banking Customer Data
Analyze banking data to detect missing account information and understand customer demographics.
Dataset (Kaggle – Public): https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis
Discription of the code:
          This Python program analyzes a marketing campaign dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset is loaded and examined to understand its structure and missing values. A new column, **Age**, is calculated from the year of birth. A histogram is used to visualize the age distribution of customers. Box plots are created to analyze income distribution and spending patterns on wines, meat products, and gold products. Overall, the program helps in understanding customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
